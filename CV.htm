<H2>Skills</H2>

<UL>
<LI><B>Programming</B>
<BR>
I am currently undertaking a Level 2 Certificate in Understanding Coding course, and working through online C++ tutorials. I achieved an A level in Computing (grade A),
which involved Visual Basic, HTML and SQL programming. I recently completed a Coding & Technology course with the Upskillist institution, which involved writing, debugging
and testing programs in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</LI>

<LI><B>Keen eye for detail</B>
<BR>
I have an excellent attention to detail, as evidenced in my previous proofreading and quality control roles, in which a meticulous, careful nature was required – for example,
in the pharma sector, the safety and wellbeing of the end users were at stake. I have achieved awards for the accuracy of my work, for example at Lowell I earned the Gold award
for 12 months of 100% quality audit results.</LI>

<LI><B>Proofreading</B>
<BR>
In one of my previous roles I was checking technical translations from German and Spanish into English for grammatical, syntactic and semantic errors, ensuring translations were
a very high-quality end product. Proofreading also formed part of my previous role as a QC Operator. I have also previously completed a self-study PTC Proofreading course.</LI>

<LI><B>Administrative support</B>
<BR>
I can type accurately and speedily, am computer literate with a high IT competency, have extensive practical experience of Microsoft applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), and have
excellent organisational skills. I have proven experience in discretion and confidentiality (for example working with confidential government documents). I have a strong ability to
concentrate, am open to flexible working hours, have a self-motivated, analytical and dedicated approach, have a strong willingness to gain new knowledge and learn new skills, and am
able to manage my own workload effectively and work unsupervised under my own initiative for long periods of time.</LI>
